* Your task is to collect all the skills and kill all the bugs. 
  You can't go to next level until you collect all the skills.
  If you are done, a transport gate will open somewhere in the map.
  Maybe we should indicate somehow the current maps elements.
  
* Bugs are getting stronger and stronger, so you have to upgrade your skills
  Bugs will have 
    errors -> How many attack power will you have to have to solve it
    headache_factor -> How many damage does it cause

* Bugs:
  every menthal_damage will be 15 until you fix it
